# Creating a new Dagster project

The easiest way to start building a Dagster project is by using the `dagster project` CLI. This CLI tool helps generate files and folder structures that enable you to quickly get started with Dagster.

---

## Bootstrapping a new project

You can scaffold a new project using the default project skeleton, or start with one of the official Dagster examples.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Starting with the default project skeleton">
To get started, you can run:

```bash
pip install dagster
dagster project scaffold --name my-dagster-project
```

The command `dagster project scaffold` generates a folder structure with a single Dagster code location and other files such as `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`. This helps you to quickly start with an empty project with everything set up.

Here's a breakdown of the files and directories that are generated:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "25%",
        }}
      >

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>my_dagster_project/</td>
      <td>A Python package that contains code for your new Dagster code.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>my_dagster_project_tests/</td>
      <td>
        A Python package that contains tests for{" "}
        <code>my_dagster_project.</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>README.md</td>
      <td>A description and starter guide for your new Dagster project.</td>

      <td>
        A file that specifies package core metadata in static, tool-agnostic
        way.
        <br />
        It includes a <code>tool.dagster</code> section which references to your
        Dagster project as a python package. This allows you to type just
        `dagit` without any parameters in order to load your Dagster code. Visit{" "}

        and meant to replace <code>setup.py</code>, but we may still include a{" "}
        <code>setup.py</code> for compatibility with tools that do not use this
        spec.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>setup.py</td>
      <td>
        A build script with Python package dependencies for your new project as
        a package.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>setup.cfg</td>
      <td>
        An ini file that contains option defaults for <code>setup.py</code>{" "}
        commands.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Inside of the `my_dagster_project/` directory, the following files and directories are generated:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>my_dagster_project/__init__.py</td>
      <td>
        The <code>__init__.py</code> file includes a{" "}
        <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object that contains all the definitions defined within your project. A definition can be an asset, a job, a schedule, a sensor, or a resource. This allows Dagster to load the definitions in an installed package.

        A Python module that contains {" "}
        <a href="/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets">Software-Defined Assets</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Note: As your project grows, we recommend organizing assets in subpackages, e.g. <code>my_dagster_project/assets/analytics.py</code>, so that you can use{" "}
        <PyObject object="load_assets_from_package_module" /> to load assets into your project and
        group them based on the folder structure, rather than needing to manually group assets every time you define one.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Starting with an official example">

Alternatively, you can start with one of the official Dagster examples.

To get started, you can run:

```bash
pip install dagster
dagster project from-example \
  --name my-dagster-project \
  --example quickstart_etl
```

The command `dagster project from-example` downloads one of the official Dagster examples to the current directory. This command enables you to quickly bootstrap your project with an officially maintained example.

For more info about the examples, visit the [Dagster GitHub repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples) or use `dagster project list-examples`.

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

## Getting started

The newly generated `my-dagster-project` directory is a fully functioning [Python package](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) and can be installed with `pip`. To install it as a package and its Python dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

<Note>
  By using the <code>--editable</code> flag, <code>pip</code> will install your
  code location as a Python package in{" "}
  <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs">
    "editable mode"
  </a>{" "}
  so that as you develop, local code changes will automatically apply.
</Note>

Then, start the Dagit web server:

```bash
dagit
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the project.

Now, you can start writing assets in `my_dagster_project/assets.pypy`, define your own ops or jobs, and include them in `my_dagster_project/__init__.py`.

## Development

- [Adding new Python dependencies](#adding-new-python-dependencies)
- [Environment variables and secrets](#environment-variables-and-secrets)
- [Unit testing](#unit-testing)
- [Schedules and sensors](#schedules-and-sensors)

### Adding new Python dependencies

You can specify new Python dependencies in `setup.py`.

### Environment variables and secrets

<EnvironmentVariablesIntro />

Refer to the [Using environment variables and secrets in Dagster code guide](/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets) for more info and examples.

### Unit testing

Tests can be added in the `my_dagster_project_tests` directory and you can run tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest my_dagster_project_tests
```

### Schedules and sensors

If you want to enable Dagster [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) or [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors), you will need to start a [Dagster Daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon).

Start a daemon process in the same folder as your `workspace.yaml` file, but in a different shell or terminal:

```bash
dagster-daemon run
```

<Note>

The `$DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable must be set to a directory for the daemon to work. <strong>Note:</strong> using directories within `/tmp/` may cause issues. See <Link href="/deployment/dagster-instance#default-local-behavior">Dagster Instance default local behavior</Link> for more details.

</Note>
Once your daemon process is running, you can start turning on schedules and sensors for your jobs.

## Deployment

Once your project is ready to move to production, check out our recommendation for [Transitioning Data Pipelines from Development to Production](/guides/dagster/transitioning-data-pipelines-from-development-to-production).

Check out the following resources to learn more about deployment options:

- [Dagster Cloud](/dagster-cloud) - Deploy using Dagster-managed infrastructure
- [Your own infrastrucutre](/deployment) - Deploy to your own infrastructure, such as Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services, etc.
