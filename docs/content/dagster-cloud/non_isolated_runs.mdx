# Choosing run isolation in Serverless

Dagster Cloud Serverless offers 2 levels of run isolation: isolated and non-isolated.

## Isolated runs

Isolated runs take place in their own container with their own compute resources: 4 cpu cores and 16Gb of memory.

These runs may take up to 3 minutes to start while these resources are provisioned.

When launching runs manually, select `Isolate run environment` in the Launchpad to launch an isolated runs.
Scheduled, sensor, and backfill runs are always isolated.

## Non-isolated runs

This can be enabled or disabled in deployment settings with

```yaml
non_isolated_runs
  enabled: True
```

Non-isolated runs provide a faster start time by using a standing container for each code location.

While launching runs from the Launchpad, leave `Isolate run environment` unchecked to launch a non-isolated run.
Materializing assets from the UI also defaults to non-isolated.

Non-isolated runs have access to fewer compute resources, and they are shared with other processes for a code location
like sensors. As a result, it's recommended to use isolated runs for compute intensive jobs and materializations.

By default only one non-isolated run will execute at once. While a run is in progress, the the Launchpad will
swap to only launching isolated runs.

This limit can be configured in deployment settings. Take caution; The limit is in place to help wih avoiding crashes due to OOMs.

```yaml
non_isolated_runs
  enabled: True
  max_concurrent_non_isolated_runs: 1
```
